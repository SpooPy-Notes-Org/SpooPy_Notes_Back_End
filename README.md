## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Go to "this" URL and submit a string in the query string.  The program will return your text in an image... a creepy, ransom note. 

Take a picture of a collection of text and subtmit it our application. 

Our application will create a web page with the text parsed out from the photograph so it will be readable.

Take a picture of text, rearrange the tex,t and recreate the image using altered versions of the original words
